This way, each team member is responsible for a part of the application, but also has some overlap to ensure continuity.

Let me detail this further:

Detailed Task Allocation
Team A (Focus on Login & Seats Display)

Login Module:

Create User class.
Implement login check.
Handle user authentication errors.
Seats Display:

Read seat data from file.
Generate 2D representation of seats for display.
Data Storage/Retrieval:

Implement methods to read/write seat and movie data.
Team B (Focus on Movie List & Payment)

Movie List Module:

Read movie data from file.
Display in a list with details like title, year, category.
Allow sorting and filtering options.
Choosing Movie:

Create a menu system to select movies by ID or category.
Highlight selected movie when returning to the main list.
Payment Module:

Implement payment processing (simulated for now).
Store booking details in a file.
Output payment confirmation with ticket information.
Team C (Focus on Admin & Application Flow)

Admin Account Management:

Create AdminUser class.
Implement admin login check.
Add functions to modify movie data based on showtimes.
Application Flow:

Manage transitions between modules.
Ensure user can navigate back or proceed as needed.
Implement error handling for invalid actions.
Testing:

Conduct unit tests for all modules.
Perform end-to-end testing to ensure everything works together.
Documentation:

Write user manual and admin guide.
Document error cases and debugging procedures.
Final Checks & Deployment:

Review code for bugs and performance issues.
Deploy the application to the designated location.
This allocation seems balanced, but I need to make sure each task is clear and can be completed within 18 days without overlap causing confusion.

Perhaps adding a table or list that clearly assigns each task to a team member would help in understanding responsibilities. Also, setting up daily goals or milestones might ensure progress stays on track.

Another consideration is the difficulty level of tasks. For example, the Payment Module may require more attention to detail than other modules, so assigning it to someone with good attention to detail could be beneficial.

Similarly, the Admin Account Management involves managing file operations and user permissions, which requires careful implementation to avoid data corruption or security issues.

I also need to schedule regular check-ins or meetings to address any blockers or challenges my team members might face. This way, we can adjust tasks as needed and keep everyone motivated.

Overall, this plan seems solid, but I should present it in a clear, organized manner to ensure each team member understands their role and responsibilities without ambiguity.
